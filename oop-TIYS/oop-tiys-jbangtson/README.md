## Introduction
In this TYIS we create a few classes and have them interact with each other!

### Object Map

As visualized in the figure below, a house can have multple robots and robots can have multiple helpers. The figure shows how the current code in the Program.cs functions.

### Try It Yourself

Classes and objects can seem confusing at first; I know that I struggled with the concept for a bit. The purpose of this TYIS is to explore these concepts away from your homework code. 

I encourage you to play around with this a bit! Some things you could try are:
* Add some more helpers to the robots. 
* Add a robot to the vacant house.
* Create a human class and add a human to one of the houses.
* Explore the concept of static lists, variables, etc.
